## 🏡 House Price Regression - Process Overview

This notebook demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow to predict house prices using regression. The process includes:

1. **Data Loading**: Import the housing dataset using pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove irrelevant features, and convert categorical variables if needed.
3. **Feature Selection**: Choose relevant numerical and categorical features that influence house prices.
4. **Train-Test Split**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
5. **Model Training**: Use a regression algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression) from scikit-learn to train the model.
6. **Prediction**: Apply the trained model to the test set to predict house prices.
7. **Evaluation**: Measure performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R² score.
